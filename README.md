# XNAP: Making LSTM-based Next Activity Predictions Explainable by Using LRP

We integrated an adapted version of the LRP approach of Arras et al. (2017) into a predictive business process monitoring technique for predicting next activities.

Future tasks:
- Further evaluation; conduction of an workshop with process analysts 
- Adaption of the propagation rules of XNAP's LRP to also determine the relevance values of context attributes
- Comparision of LRP to a model-agnostic approach like LIME
